# ChitChat-ClientServerArchitecture
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a client-server chat application built using a client-server architecture. The application allows multiple clients to connect to a server and engage in real-time chat conversations.



**Key Features:**

- **Client-Server Architecture:** The chat application follows a client-server model, where clients establish connections with the server to exchange messages and participate in chat sessions.

- **User Authentication:** The application implements secure user authentication mechanisms to ensure authorized access to the chat system. Users can authenticate themselves with the server to join chat rooms and interact with other participants.

- **Chat Rooms:** The chat application supports the creation and management of multiple chat rooms. Users can join specific chat rooms to participate in focused discussions and communicate with other users in the same room.

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Clients can send and receive messages in real-time. Messages are broadcasted to all participants within the same chat room, ensuring seamless communication and collaboration.

- **Efficient Communication:** The application optimizes network communication, leveraging techniques such as message compression, efficient serialization/deserialization, and minimizing network latency to ensure efficient data transfer.

- **Robustness and Error Handling:** The chat application incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to handle various scenarios, including network failures, disconnections, and unexpected client behavior. It gracefully handles exceptions and errors to maintain stability and provide a seamless user experience.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up and run the chat server using the provided server-side code.
3. Compile and run the chat client application on each client machine to connect to the server and start chatting.
